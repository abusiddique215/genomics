<high_level_desc›Build an AI-enhanced personalized treatment recommendation system using genomics data. The system must analyze a patient's genetic profile and medical history to suggest tailored treatment options, predict treatment efficacy, and present these insights in a Power BI dashboard for healthcare providers. Ensure the system is modular, scalable, and integrates AI models trained on genomics datasets with support for detailed logging and analysis.‹/high_level_desc>

‹system1>The first system will focus on data ingestion, model training, and treatment prediction:
- **Genomics Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**: Build a pipeline to ingest and preprocess large-scale genomics data. The system should support multiple data formats (e.g., CSV, FASTA) and handle missing or noisy data. Logs must track every data ingestion event, noting the file type, size, and preprocessing steps applied (e.g., data normalization, feature extraction).
  
- **Patient Medical History Integration**: Allow healthcare providers to input or upload patient medical history, including pre-existing conditions and previous treatments. This data should be integrated with genomics data to create a comprehensive profile. Logs must track every patient history upload and any manual edits or updates made by the provider.

- **AI Model for Treatment Prediction**: Train an AI model (using **TensorFlow**) that analyzes genomics data and medical history to recommend personalized treatment options. The model should also predict the efficacy of specific treatments based on genetic markers. Logs must capture model training sessions, including the dataset used, training duration, model version, and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

- **Treatment Efficacy Prediction**: The system must predict the likely success of recommended treatments based on a patient’s genetic profile. Include visual indicators of efficacy (e.g., high, medium, low) in the model output. Logs should track every treatment recommendation and efficacy prediction, including timestamped predictions and success probabilities.‹/system1>

‹system2›This system will focus on visualization, user interaction, and data exploration in Power BI:
- **Power BI Integration**: Connect the AI model to **Power BI** to allow healthcare providers to explore personalized treatment options and predicted efficacy for each patient. The Power BI dashboard must allow doctors to view a summary of genomic markers, recommended treatments, and success probabilities, with interactive features to adjust or compare different treatment paths. Logs must track every Power BI interaction, including dashboard views, user queries, and adjustments to treatment paths.

- **Interactive Dashboard for Treatment Exploration**: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard where doctors can explore different treatment paths, adjust the model’s input parameters (e.g., filtering based on genetic markers), and view real-time predictions. The dashboard should allow users to generate customized reports, comparing the likely efficacy of different treatments. All dashboard activity must be logged, including user interactions and changes to parameter settings.

- **Patient Progress Tracking and Reporting**: The system should allow healthcare providers to track the progress of treatments over time. Doctors can update patient records with treatment outcomes, and the system will adjust future predictions based on this data. Include the ability to generate detailed reports summarizing treatment efficacy and patient progress. Logs must track all updates to patient progress and report generation events.‹/system2›

<improvements>The system must continuously improve over time, incorporating new genomics datasets and patient outcomes to refine its predictions. Feedback from healthcare providers should be collected and logged, allowing the model to adjust its treatment recommendations based on real-world data. The system should be designed to handle future expansions, including new treatment options and additional genetic markers. Logs should be exportable for analysis and model retraining to enhance accuracy and treatment effectiveness.‹/improvements>

<prompt>Now build both system1 and system2 in a modular, scalable approach that supports detailed logging, AI-driven treatment predictions, and integration with Power BI for interactive data exploration. Ensure the system can ingest and preprocess genomics data, train models in **TensorFlow**, and generate treatment efficacy predictions. Provide clear, step-by-step setup instructions for both technical and non-technical users, including guidelines for connecting the AI models to Power BI. The code must be scalable for future expansions, supporting the integration of new genetic markers, treatments, and patient data. Ensure user feedback is logged to refine the model over time.<prompt>
