## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our system seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL].

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Considerations

Our system handles sensitive medical and genomic data. As such, we have implemented several security measures:

1. **Data Encryption**
   - All data in transit is encrypted using TLS
   - Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using industry-standard encryption

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for all endpoints
   - Secure authentication and authorization

3. **Input Validation**
   - All user input is validated and sanitized
   - Protection against common injection attacks

4. **Audit Logging**
   - All system actions are logged
   - Audit trails for sensitive operations

5. **Compliance**
   - HIPAA compliance measures
   - GDPR considerations for genomic data

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these security best practices:

1. Never commit sensitive credentials
2. Always validate user input
3. Use prepared statements for database queries
4. Keep dependencies up to date
5. Follow the principle of least privilege
6. Implement proper error handling
7. Use secure communication protocols

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
