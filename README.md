# AI-Enhanced Genomics Treatment Recommendation System

A scalable, microservices-based system for analyzing genomic data and providing personalized treatment recommendations using AI/ML.

## Overview

This system analyzes patient genetic profiles and medical histories to suggest tailored treatment options, predict treatment efficacy, and present insights via interactive dashboards. It uses advanced AI models trained on genomics datasets to provide data-driven treatment recommendations.

### Key Features

- **Genomics Data Analysis**: Process and analyze large-scale genomics data
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Generate personalized treatment recommendations
- **Treatment Efficacy Prediction**: Predict success probabilities for treatments
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize patient data and recommendations
- **Secure Data Handling**: HIPAA-compliant data management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices-based design for scalability

## Architecture

The system consists of several microservices:

- **Patient Management Service**: Handle patient data and records
- **Treatment Prediction Service**: AI-powered treatment recommendations
- **Data Ingestion Service**: Process incoming genomic and medical data
- **Dashboard Service**: Interactive data visualization

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- **Database**: DynamoDB
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Documentation**: MkDocs
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- AWS Account (for DynamoDB)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genomics-treatment-system.git
   cd genomics-treatment-system
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Update environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the services:
   ```bash
   ./docker-manage.sh start
   ```

### Development Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Usage

### Starting Services

Use the Docker management script:
```bash
./docker-manage.sh [command]

Commands:
  start    - Start all services
  stop     - Stop all services
  restart  - Restart all services
  build    - Build all services
  logs     - Show logs from all services
  status   - Show status of all services
  clean    - Remove all containers and images
  test     - Run tests in containers
```

### Making API Requests

#### Patient Management
```python
import requests

# Create patient
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8080/patients",
    json={
        "id": "P001",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "genomic_data": {...},
        "medical_history": {...}
    }
)

# Get treatment recommendation
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8080/patients/P001/treatment_recommendation"
)
```

#### Data Ingestion
```python
# Ingest genomic data
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8084/ingest/patient",
    json={
        "patient_id": "P001",
        "genomic_data": {...}
    }
)
```

## Testing
