# AI-Enhanced Treatment Recommendation System

## Overview
Build a scalable, modular system that leverages genomics data and AI to provide personalized treatment recommendations. The system will analyze patient genetic profiles and medical histories, predict treatment efficacy, and present insights via a Power BI dashboard.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
- Support multiple genomics data formats (CSV, FASTA)
- Handle missing/noisy data
- Integrate patient medical history
- Log all ingestion and preprocessing steps

### 2. AI Model Development
- Use TensorFlow for model training
- Analyze genomics data and medical history
- Predict treatment options and efficacy
- Log model training sessions and performance metrics

### 3. Treatment Prediction and Analysis
- Generate personalized treatment recommendations
- Predict efficacy with visual indicators (high, medium, low)
- Allow for comparison of different treatment paths
- Log all predictions and recommendations

### 4. Power BI Integration
- Create interactive dashboards for treatment exploration
- Enable real-time prediction updates based on parameter adjustments
- Support customized report generation
- Track and log all user interactions

### 5. Patient Progress Tracking
- Update patient records with treatment outcomes
- Adjust future predictions based on real-world data
- Generate detailed progress reports
- Log all updates and report generations

## Development Guidelines

1. Modular Architecture
   - Develop each component as a separate microservice
   - Use Docker containers for consistency and scalability

2. Scalability
   - Design data pipelines to handle large-scale genomics datasets
   - Implement horizontal scaling for compute-intensive tasks

3. AI Model Management
   - Version control for AI models
   - Implement A/B testing capabilities for model improvements

4. Logging and Monitoring
   - Implement comprehensive logging across all system components
   - Set up real-time monitoring and alerting

5. Security and Compliance
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance for patient data handling
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest

6. User Feedback Integration
   - Develop a system to collect and incorporate healthcare provider feedback
   - Use feedback to refine AI models and improve recommendations

7. Documentation
   - Maintain thorough API documentation
   - Create user guides for both technical and non-technical users

8. Testing
   - Implement unit tests for all components
   - Develop integration tests for system-wide functionality
   - Perform regular security audits

9. Continuous Improvement
   - Plan for regular updates to incorporate new genomics research
   - Design flexible data schemas to accommodate future expansions

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set up cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure
- [ ] Deploy and configure databases (PostgreSQL and MongoDB)
