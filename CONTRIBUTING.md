# Contributing to AI-Enhanced Treatment Recommendation System

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for Python code formatting
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Write meaningful commit messages following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Document your code using docstrings and comments

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include integration tests where appropriate
- Test coverage should not decrease

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the requirements.txt if you add dependencies
3. Update the documentation if you change APIs
4. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two maintainers

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests. Suggest a feature by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new).

**Great Feature Requests** tend to have:

- A clear and detailed description of the feature
- The motivation for the feature
- Possible implementation approaches
- Whether you want to implement it yourself

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the PR if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

- Be welcoming to newcomers
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
